A selection of graphs from a LiChess data study:

## White Rating (Normalized) by Opening Type

- It appears the higher rated players tend to play E openings (Indian Defences such as King's Indian or Nimzo-Indian)

## Number of turns taken by match result

- This suggests that when a game moves past (approximately) the 75 move mark it is likely that game will end in a draw
- It also shows that games where Black wins tend to last slightly longer than games where White wins, perhaps due to the fact that White moves first
