## Python Analysis

![count of movies by genre AND genre by average rating](/assets/images/count-of-movies-by-genre-AND-genre-by-average-rating.png "count-of-movies-by-genre-AND-genre-by-average-rating")

![num-movies-released-by-year-AND-count-of-rating](/assets/images/num-movies-released-by-year-AND-count-of-rating.png "num-movies-released-by-year-AND-count-of-rating")

Both graphs are left skewed, suggesting that most ratings are a little high, and more movies are released now than say 30 years ago.

This suggests that an average movie rating on IMDb isnt the middle score, 5, but around 7. So for a movie to be considered to have an above average rating, it should have a rating **greater than 7**.

## Predictive Analysis

![imdb-rise-avg-rating_80s](/assets/images/imdb-rise-avg-rating-80s.png "Rise in average IMDb ratings since 80s")

### This suggests that in 2030, the average rating on IMDb will be between 7.0 and 7.4
### To make an above average film in 2030, it must have a rating approximately >= 7.5
