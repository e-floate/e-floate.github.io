    <h1>Lichess graphs</h1>
<p>10 Feb 2022 - </p>

<p>A selection of graphs from a LiChess data study:</p>

<h2 id="white-rating-normalized-by-opening-type">White Rating (Normalized) by Opening Type</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/images/Opening_Type_v_Rating.png" alt="White Rating (Normalized) by Opening Type" title="White Rating (Normalized) by Opening Type" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>It appears the higher rated players tend to play E openings (Indian Defences such as Kingâ€™s Indian or Nimzo-Indian)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="number-of-turns-taken-by-match-result">Number of turns taken by match result</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/images/Turns_Dist_by_Result.png" alt="Graph 2" title="graph" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>This suggests that when a game moves past (approximately) the 75 move mark it is likely that game will end in a draw</li>
  <li>It also shows that games where Black wins tend to last slightly longer than games where White wins, perhaps due to the fact that White moves first</li>
</ul>
