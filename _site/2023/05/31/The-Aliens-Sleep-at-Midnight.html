    <h1>The aliens sleep at midnight</h1>
<p>31 May 2023 - </p>

<p>If, one sunny July evening in California, your watch ticks past 9pm, and wanted to see some UFOs, you’d have picked the best place and time to do it! (Allegedly)</p>

<p>The majority of UFO sightings are between 6PM and 12AM, perhaps that’s when their celestial-bedtime rolls around…</p>

<p>Just over half of all sightings occur between July and November! And a disproportionately low amount of sightings take place in the festive month of December, likely the work of Saint Nick!</p>
