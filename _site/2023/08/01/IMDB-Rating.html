<p>Both graphs are left skewed, suggesting that most ratings are a little high, and more movies are released now than say 30 years ago.</p>

<p>This suggests that an average movie rating on IMDb isnt the middle score, 5, but around 7. So for a movie to be considered to have an above average rating, it should have a rating <strong>greater than 7</strong>.</p>
