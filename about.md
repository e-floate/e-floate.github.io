Hey! I'm Ethan Floate - a recent graduate from the University of Brighton. After attaining a First in my course, Computer Science with Cyber Security, I am eager to put these recently developed skills to use. So, I present to you a portfolio of my data analysis projects. This is the kind of high-quality analysis I could bring to your company, alongside actionable insights that will improve the efficiencies of your business functions.

Simply navigate to the *Blog* tab to check out some of my data studies :)
